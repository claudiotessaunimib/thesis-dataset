I have the following Java classes. Do you see any hub-like architectural smell? These are the only classes in my project. In particular, an hub-like architectural smell arises when an abstraction has a large number of incoming and outgoing dependencies, making the dependency structure look like a hub.

Do not explain what is an architectural smell or how to remove it, just say if you see some or not. You don't need to specify which class is the hub-like class.
