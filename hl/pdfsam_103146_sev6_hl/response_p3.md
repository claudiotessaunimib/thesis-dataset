## Code Analysis:

The provided code exhibits a Hub-Like Dependency smell primarily centered around the `I18nContext` class. Almost every other class directly depends on this class for internationalization (i18n) via the `i18n()` static method. This is evident in lines like:

-   `SplitByBookmarksTool`: `.name(i18n().tr("Split by bookmarks"))`
-   `SplitTool`: `.description(i18n().tr("Split a PDF document at the given page numbers."))`
-   `SplitBySizeTool`: `.name(i18n().tr("Split by size"))`
-   `SplitToolPanel`: `this.selectionPane.setPromptText(i18n().tr("Select or drag and drop the PDF you want to split"));`
-   Many other components using `i18n().tr(...)` for localized strings.

This makes `I18nContext` a central hub, with numerous classes directly coupled to it. While the `I18nContext` itself isn't overly complex, the widespread dependency creates the hub-like structure and associated problems.

## Impact Discussion:

The hub-like dependency on `I18nContext` introduces several maintainability and scalability issues:

-   **Rigidity:** Changes to the `I18nContext` (e.g., switching the i18n library, changing the resource bundle format) would impact a large portion of the application, requiring significant rework and retesting.
-   **Reduced Reusability:** Components become tightly coupled to the specific i18n mechanism, making them harder to reuse in other contexts where a different i18n approach might be preferred.
-   **Testability Challenges:** Unit testing components becomes more complex as it requires mocking or stubbing the `I18nContext` to isolate the component's logic.
-   **Unnecessary Recompilation:** Even minor changes to translation strings can trigger recompilation of many dependent classes, slowing down the development process.
-   **Scalability Issues:** As the application grows, the central hub becomes increasingly burdened, potentially creating performance bottlenecks or hindering parallel development efforts.

## Proposed Remedies:

To resolve the hub-like dependency on `I18nContext`, consider these refactoring strategies:

1. **Dependency Injection:** Instead of directly calling `i18n()`, inject an interface (e.g., `I18nService`) into dependent classes. This decouples components from the concrete `I18nContext` implementation.

    ```java
    interface I18nService {
        String tr(String key);
    }

    class I18nServiceImpl implements I18nService {
        // ... implementation using I18nContext ...
    }

    // In dependent classes:
    @Inject private I18nService i18nService;

    // Usage:
    String localizedText = i18nService.tr("my_key");
    ```

2. **Resource Bundles with Dedicated Loaders:** Each module or component could load its own resource bundles directly, eliminating the need for a central hub. This increases modularity and reduces dependencies.

3. **Event-Driven Localization:** Components could publish events requesting localized strings. A dedicated i18n service could listen for these events and provide the translations. This introduces a level of indirection and decoupling.

4. **Static String Lookups in Components:** For simpler cases, components could define static final String constants for localized texts, loaded directly from resource bundles within the component. This is suitable when the number of strings is small and the complexity is low.

## Final Explanation:

The provided Java code demonstrates a Hub-Like Dependency architectural smell through the excessive reliance on the `I18nContext` class for internationalization. This central hub becomes a bottleneck for maintainability, reusability, and scalability. By decoupling components from the `I18nContext` using techniques like dependency injection, dedicated resource bundle loaders, or event-driven localization, you can improve the overall design, reduce the impact of changes, and facilitate easier testing and future growth. Choose the refactoring strategy that best suits the complexity and scale of your application. For larger applications, dependency injection with an `I18nService` interface is often the most flexible and maintainable solution.
