## Hub-Like Dependency Smell Explanation based on provided code

The provided code exhibits a Hub-Like Dependency smell centered around the `TS3ApiAsync` class. Let's break down why this is a problem and how to address it.

**Code Analysis:**

The `TS3ApiAsync` class acts as a central hub, providing a vast number of methods that interact with a TeamSpeak 3 server. Almost all operations, from ban management and channel manipulation to file transfer and server control, are funneled through this single class. This is evident by observing the sheer number of public methods within `TS3ApiAsync` and how other classes like `TS3Api` depend entirely on it for server interaction. `TS3Api` merely provides synchronous wrappers around the asynchronous methods of `TS3ApiAsync`, further reinforcing the hub-like nature.

**Impact Discussion:**

This centralized structure has several negative consequences:

-   **Low Maintainability:** Changes to the TeamSpeak server API or internal logic often require modifications to the `TS3ApiAsync` class, which can have cascading effects throughout the entire system. The large number of methods makes understanding and modifying the class challenging, increasing the risk of introducing bugs.
-   **Low Reusability:** Because all functionality is concentrated in a single class, it is difficult to reuse parts of the code in other contexts. For example, if another project needs only file transfer capabilities, it cannot easily reuse the relevant portions of `TS3ApiAsync` without bringing in all the other dependencies.
-   **Reduced Testability:** Testing `TS3ApiAsync` becomes complex due to the high number of dependencies and responsibilities. Writing unit tests requires mocking many collaborators, making tests brittle and difficult to maintain.
-   **Scalability Issues:** As the system grows and more features are added, the `TS3ApiAsync` class will continue to expand, exacerbating the maintainability and testability issues. This makes it harder to adapt to changing requirements and increases development time.
-   **Tight Coupling:** The `TS3Api` class being a synchronous wrapper around `TS3ApiAsync` creates tight coupling between them. This limits flexibility and makes it difficult to change one without affecting the other.

**Proposed Remedies:**

To mitigate the Hub-Like Dependency smell, we need to decompose `TS3ApiAsync` into smaller, more cohesive modules. Here's how:

1. **Identify Functional Areas:** Group related functionalities into separate modules. For instance, ban management, channel operations, file transfer, server administration, and permission management could each become their own module.

2. **Create Module Interfaces:** Define interfaces for each module, specifying the public API for interacting with that functionality. This promotes loose coupling and allows modules to be used independently.

3. **Implement Module Classes:** Create separate classes that implement the module interfaces. These classes should encapsulate the logic for their specific functional area.

4. **Refactor `TS3ApiAsync` and `TS3Api`:** `TS3ApiAsync` should delegate requests to the appropriate modules. It becomes a facade, simplifying interaction with the system without containing the core logic. `TS3Api` can then be adapted to call the same modules directly, removing the intermediary layer and the tight coupling.

**Example (Partial):**

```java
interface BanManagement {
  CommandFuture<Integer> addBan(String ip, String name, String uid, long timeInSeconds, String reason);
  // ... other ban related methods
}

class BanManager implements BanManagement {
  // ... implementation of ban related methods
}

// Refactored TS3ApiAsync
class TS3ApiAsync {
  private final BanManagement banManagement;
  // ... other modules

  TS3ApiAsync(BanManagement banManagement, /* ... other modules */) {
    this.banManagement = banManagement;
    // ... initialize other modules
  }

  public CommandFuture<Integer> addBan(String ip, String name, String uid, long timeInSeconds, String reason) {
    return banManagement.addBan(ip, name, uid, timeInSeconds, reason);
  }
    // ... other methods delegating to appropriate modules
}
```

By applying this modular approach across all functional areas, we can decouple the code, improve maintainability, testability, and scalability, and make the system more robust and adaptable to future changes. This approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and promotes a more modular and maintainable architecture.
