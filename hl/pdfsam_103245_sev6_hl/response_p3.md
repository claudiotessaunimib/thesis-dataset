## Code Analysis:

The provided code exhibits a Hub-Like Dependency smell centered around the `Footer` class. Several tool classes (`MergeTool`, `RotateTool`, `SplitBySizeTool`, `ExtractTool`, `AddBackpagesTool`, `SplitTool`, `SplitByBookmarksTool`, `AlternateMixTool`) all depend on the `Footer` class to manage their progress bars, status labels, open and run buttons. This is evident in the `ModuleConfig` inner classes of each tool, where a `Footer` instance is provided, injecting dependencies to `RunButton` and `OpenButton`. Furthermore, `OpenButton` interacts with the `Footer` through the `eventStudio` for updates and output handling.

Additionally, several classes depend on `I18nContext`, making it another potential hub, although less pronounced than the `Footer` case. Tools depend on `I18nContext` for translations, while `PdfDocumentDescriptor` uses it for exception messages.

## Impact Discussion:

The hub-like dependency on `Footer` creates several maintainability and scalability problems:

-   **Rigidity:** Changes to the `Footer` class, such as adding new UI elements or modifying its behavior, can have cascading effects on all dependent tool classes. This makes it difficult and risky to modify the `Footer` and hinders the evolution of the UI.
-   **Low Reusability:** The `Footer` is tightly coupled to the specific tools, making it challenging to reuse it in other contexts or projects.
-   **Testability:** Testing individual tools becomes more complex because of the implicit dependency on `Footer`. Mocks or stubs might be necessary to isolate the tool's logic from the UI, increasing testing overhead.
-   **Unclear Responsibilities:** The `Footer` class accumulates responsibilities related to progress reporting, task completion handling, and button management. This blurring of concerns reduces the cohesion of the `Footer` class and makes it harder to understand and maintain.

The dependence on `I18nContext`, while not as critical as the `Footer` dependency, can still lead to some rigidity. Changes in the internationalization mechanism could impact several parts of the application.

## Proposed Remedies:

The core problem is the direct dependence of multiple tool classes on the concrete `Footer` implementation. We can decouple the tools from the `Footer` using several strategies:

1. **Observer Pattern:** Introduce an interface or abstract class representing the "Task Status Observer". The `Footer` would implement this interface. Each tool would then publish events related to task progress, completion, or failure. The `Footer` would subscribe to these events and update its UI accordingly. This decoupling allows changing or replacing the `Footer` without impacting the tools.

2. **Mediation Pattern:** Create a "ToolUIManager" mediator. Tools would communicate their status changes to the mediator, and the mediator would update the UI elements in the `Footer` (or any other attached UI). This removes direct dependency between tools and the concrete UI.

3. **Dependency Injection with Interfaces:** Define an interface for the functionality provided by the `Footer`, like `TaskStatusReporter`. Inject an implementation of this interface into the tool classes. This allows for different implementations (e.g., console-based reporter, detailed logging reporter) to be used without modifying the tools.

For the `I18nContext`, the current implementation based on static access could be improved by using dependency injection to inject the `I18nContext` into classes that need it. This would improve testability and allow for easier replacement of the internationalization mechanism if needed.
