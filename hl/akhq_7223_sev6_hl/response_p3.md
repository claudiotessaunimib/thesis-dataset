Okay, let's break down the provided Java code and analyze the Hub-Like Dependency smell.

**Code Analysis:**

The code consists of several packages and classes, primarily within `org.akhq`. Let's examine the key elements and their relationships:

-   **`org.akhq.repositories`:** This package contains several classes that appear to act as data access objects or repositories:

    -   `ClusterRepository`
    -   `AccessControlListRepository`
    -   `ConsumerGroupRepository`
    -   `TopicRepository`
    -   `LogDirRepository`
    -   `ConfigRepository`
    -   `AbstractRepository`: Likely a base class for the repositories, containing common functionality.
    -   All the repositories mentioned above depends on `AbstractKafkaWrapper`.

-   **`org.akhq.modules`:**

    -   `AbstractKafkaWrapper`: This class is a central point of interaction with Kafka. It provides methods for describing clusters, listing topics, describing topics, creating/altering/deleting topics, managing consumer groups, describing log directories, managing configurations, and handling ACLs. It is injected into almost _every_ repository in `org.akhq.repositories`. The class methods makes calls to the external dependency, represented by `KafkaModule`, as well to internal classes such `AuditModule`. There are also multiple maps that act as a cache to the results of previous calls (i.e. `cluster`, `listTopics`, `describeTopics`, `describeTopicsOffsets`, `listConsumerGroups`, `describeConsumerGroups`, `consumerGroupOffset`, `logDirs`, `describeConfigs`, `describeAcls`).
    -   `KafkaModule`: Manages connections to Kafka, Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, and KSQL DB. It creates and provides clients for interacting with these services. It is a dependency of `AbstractKafkaWrapper`.
    -   `AuditModule`: It is responsible for the audit events. `AbstractKafkaWrapper` also depends on it.
    -   `KafkaWrapperRequestScope`: Extends `AbstractKafkaWrapper`, suggesting it provides request-scoped Kafka interactions.

-   **`org.akhq.models`:**

    -   It contains data transfer objects. In particular, we find:
        -   `Cluster`
        -   `Partition` and `Partition.Offsets`
        -   `org.akhq.models.audit`: Contains models specifically for audit events, including `TopicAuditEvent` and `ConsumerGroupAuditEvent`.

-   **`org.akhq.controllers`:**

    -   `GroupController`: Handles API requests related to consumer groups. It uses `AbstractKafkaWrapper`, `ConsumerGroupRepository`, `RecordRepository`, and `AccessControlListRepository`.
    -   `TopicController`: Handles API requests related to topics. It has numerous dependencies, including `AbstractKafkaWrapper`, `TopicRepository`, `ConfigRepository`, `RecordRepository`, `ConsumerGroupRepository`, `AccessControlListRepository`, and `SchemaRegistryRepository`.

-   **`org.akhq.configs`:**

    -   It contains configuration models.

-   **Dependencies Summary:** The class `AbstractKafkaWrapper` stands out as the central hub. Nearly every repository class (`*Repository`) has a `@Inject` dependency on `AbstractKafkaWrapper`. `GroupController` and `TopicController` _also_ depend directly on `AbstractKafkaWrapper`. This creates a star-like dependency graph centered on `AbstractKafkaWrapper`. Also, the several maps inside of the `AbstractKafkaWrapper` indicate that the class has a complex state.

**Impact Discussion:**

-   **Maintainability Issues:** Because so many components depend directly on `AbstractKafkaWrapper`, any change to this class has a high potential to ripple through the entire application. If the Kafka API changes, or if the way AKHQ interacts with Kafka needs to be modified, the `AbstractKafkaWrapper` becomes a bottleneck for those changes. Developers need to be very careful when modifying it, as even small changes could break seemingly unrelated parts of the system. This increases the risk of introducing bugs and makes the system harder to evolve. The multiple internal states (the Maps) amplifies the risk.

-   **Scalability Issues:** Although less direct than maintainability, the tight coupling can indirectly impact scalability. If `AbstractKafkaWrapper` becomes a performance bottleneck (e.g., due to excessive locking or inefficient operations), it will limit the overall throughput of the application, as so many components rely on it.

-   **Testability Issues:** The heavy reliance on `AbstractKafkaWrapper` makes unit testing the individual repositories and controllers more difficult. To test a repository in isolation, you ideally want to mock its dependencies. However, because the core Kafka interaction logic is embedded within `AbstractKafkaWrapper`, it's harder to create lightweight, focused tests. You end up needing to mock a large, complex class, or worse, perform integration tests that require a running Kafka instance even for simple repository logic.

-   **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle:** `AbstractKafkaWrapper` is doing _too much_. It's responsible for cluster management, topic management, consumer group management, configuration, ACLs, and more. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a class should have only one reason to change. `AbstractKafkaWrapper` has _many_ reasons to change.

-   **Tight Coupling:** The code exhibits tight coupling. Changes in one part of the system (e.g., how consumer groups are handled) necessitate changes in `AbstractKafkaWrapper`, which then potentially affects other unrelated parts (e.g., topic listing).

**Propose Remedies:**

The core strategy is to _decouple_ the components and reduce the responsibilities of `AbstractKafkaWrapper`. Here's a multi-step approach:

1.  **Introduce Interfaces:** Instead of having the repositories depend directly on the concrete `AbstractKafkaWrapper` class, define interfaces that represent specific Kafka operations. For example:

    -   `TopicService` (with methods like `listTopics`, `describeTopic`, `createTopic`, etc.)
    -   `ConsumerGroupService` (with methods like `listConsumerGroups`, `describeConsumerGroup`, etc.)
    -   `ClusterService` (with methods like `describeCluster`)
    -   `ConfigService`
    -   `AclService`
    -   ... and so on.

    These interfaces should be placed in a package that's accessible to both the `repositories` and `modules` (e.g., a new `org.akhq.service` or `org.akhq.kafka` package). The repositories would then depend on these _interfaces_, not the concrete class.

2.  **Implement Interfaces:** Create concrete implementations of these interfaces. You can initially refactor `AbstractKafkaWrapper` to implement _all_ of these interfaces. This is a stepping stone, not the final goal.

3.  **Split `AbstractKafkaWrapper`:** The crucial step. Decompose `AbstractKafkaWrapper` into smaller, more focused classes, _each_ implementing _one_ of the interfaces defined in step 1. For instance:

    -   `KafkaTopicService` (implements `TopicService`)
    -   `KafkaConsumerGroupService` (implements `ConsumerGroupService`)
    -   `KafkaClusterService` (implements `ClusterService`)
    -   ... and so on

    Each of these new classes would encapsulate the logic related to its specific area of responsibility, using the `KafkaModule` for low-level Kafka client interactions. The multiple `Map` fields that currently exist in `AbstractKafkaWrapper` can be distributed to these individual service classes, improving encapsulation.

4.  **Dependency Injection:** Use dependency injection (Micronaut's `@Inject`) to provide the appropriate _interface_ implementations to the repositories. This allows you to easily swap out implementations (e.g., for testing) and ensures that the repositories are not tied to a specific concrete class.

5.  **Refactor Controllers:** The controllers (`GroupController`, `TopicController`) should also depend on the new service interfaces (e.g., `TopicService`, `ConsumerGroupService`) rather than directly on `AbstractKafkaWrapper`.

6.  **Cache Management:** If caching is still required, move the caching logic _into_ the individual service implementations (e.g., `KafkaTopicService`). Each service can manage its own cache, specific to its needs. Consider using a dedicated caching library if the caching logic becomes complex.

**Example (Illustrative):**

```java
// org.akhq.service (or org.akhq.kafka)
public interface TopicService {
    Collection<TopicListing> listTopics(String clusterId) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException;
    Map<String, TopicDescription> describeTopics(String clusterId, List<String> topics) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException;
    // ... other topic-related methods ...
}

// org.akhq.modules
@Singleton
public class KafkaTopicService implements TopicService {
    @Inject
    private KafkaModule kafkaModule;

     private final Map<String, Map<String, TopicDescription>> describeTopics = new HashMap<>();

    @Override
    public Collection<TopicListing> listTopics(String clusterId) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        // ... implementation using kafkaModule ...
         if (!this.listTopics.containsKey(clusterId)) {
            this.listTopics.put(clusterId, Logger.call(
                kafkaModule.getAdminClient(clusterId).listTopics(
                    new ListTopicsOptions().listInternal(true)
                ).listings(),
                "List topics"
            ));
        }
        return this.listTopics.get(clusterId);
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, TopicDescription> describeTopics(String clusterId, List<String> topics) throws ExecutionException{
         describeTopics.computeIfAbsent(clusterId, s -> new HashMap<>());
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(topics);

        list.removeIf(value -> this.describeTopics.get(clusterId).containsKey(value));

        if (list.size() > 0) {
            Map<String, TopicDescription> description = Logger.call(
                kafkaModule.getAdminClient(clusterId)
                    .describeTopics(list)
                    .all(),
                "Describe Topics {}",
                topics
            );
            this.describeTopics.get(clusterId).putAll(description);
        }

        return this.describeTopics
            .get(clusterId)
            .entrySet()
            .stream()
            .filter(e -> topics.contains(e.getKey()))
            .collect(Collectors.toMap(Map.Entry::getKey, Map.Entry::getValue));
    }

    // ... other methods, ONLY related to topics ...
}

// org.akhq.repositories
@Singleton
public class TopicRepository extends AbstractRepository {
    @Inject
    private TopicService topicService; // Inject the INTERFACE

    // ... use topicService methods instead of abstractKafkaWrapper ...
     public List<String> all(String clusterId, TopicListView view, Optional<String> search, List<String> filters) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        return topicService.listTopics(clusterId) // Use the injected service
            .stream()
            .map(TopicListing::name)
            .filter(name -> isSearchMatch(search, name) && isMatchRegex(filters, name))
            .filter(name -> isListViewMatch(view, name))
            .sorted(Comparator.comparing(String::toLowerCase))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
```

**Final Explanation:**

The provided code suffers from a Hub-Like Dependency architectural smell, primarily centered around the `AbstractKafkaWrapper` class. This class acts as a single, central point of interaction with Kafka, and almost all repository classes, as well as some controllers, depend directly on it. This creates tight coupling, making the system difficult to maintain, test, and scale. Changes to `AbstractKafkaWrapper` have a high risk of cascading through the entire application.

To remedy this, we should refactor the code by introducing interfaces for specific Kafka operations (e.g., `TopicService`, `ConsumerGroupService`), creating separate, focused classes that implement these interfaces (e.g., `KafkaTopicService`, `KafkaConsumerGroupService`), and injecting these interfaces into the repositories and controllers using dependency injection. This will decouple the components, improve testability, adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, and make the system more robust and maintainable. The caching should also be handled within the individual service implementations. This approach promotes a more modular and flexible architecture.
